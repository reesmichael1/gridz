# gridz

A [Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid) inspired game. 

## Requirements

`gridz` is developed on [the master branch of Zig](https://ziglang.org). You should be simply able to run `zig build run`. 

## Roadmap

The complete gameplay will be implemented as a CLI game. After the internals are complete, a GUI will be added. It's possible the GUI will be optional and the CLI interface will continue to be maintained separately. 

Currently, only a small part of the gameplay is finished. 

## Gameplay

`gridz` has very similar gameplay to [Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid), which is a fantastic game! A separate set of rules is not yet available, but if you are familiar with Power Grid, you will know how to play `gridz`.
